I'm an aspiring software engineer from Taylor's University. 
I have three professions that I want to achieve in my lifetime.

1. A Pro Gamer
2. A Software Engineer
3. A Computer Science Lecturer

This GitHub page will hopefully be filled with the programs I make and showing off my progress 

## Thanks for reading!
